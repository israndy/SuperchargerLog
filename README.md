Python script to wake your Tesla and log SC usage near you

This script will require editing to add your Tesla user ID, also potentially update the location of the log file if you want a different location.

When run it will display what it's doing on the standard out, and saving to the .csv file. You can open this file directly or you can use the 
Plot.py script also in this archive to show the output graphically.
